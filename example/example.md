The client can be configured as either a server or browser based client in many ways, using normal TCP sockets, secure TCP sockets or websockets as needed.
Numerous examples of usage can be found in the examples directory [here](https://github.com/shamblett/mqtt_client/tree/master/example)

To get started please refer to this [example](https://github.com/shamblett/mqtt_client/blob/master/example/mqtt_server_client.dart), showing how to configure a client for basic server side MQTT operation.
